 better way to smarter healthcare

At a time when healthcare technology has never been more advanced, the industry has struggled to keep pace in improving healthcare access, cost, quality of care and patient satisfaction. But progress can take many forms, and forward-thinking organizations are redefining value and success as they continue on a path of transformation.

The IBM Health Integration Framework is a platform for implementing comprehensive solutions for providers that deliver powerful capabilities across enterprise health analytics, operations optimization, enterprise clinical integration and interoperability.

See how the University of North Carolina Health Care System established a robust, powerful IBM data warehouse to:

    Provide physicians with clearer insight into a larger cross-section of medical data, contributing to faster diagnoses and treatment decisions.
    Reduce analysis and queries to minutes instead of weeks or months.
    Leverage evidence-based treatment plans to improve the quality of patient care and the likelihood of treatment success.
